# TypeScript

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

## Basic Types in TypeScript
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that introduces static typing. Basic types in TypeScript include `number`, `string`, `boolean`, `null`, `undefined`, and more. Additionally, TypeScript allows defining custom types using `type` and `enum`.

## Interfaces, Classes, and Functions
- **Interfaces:** TypeScript allows the definition of interfaces to describe the shape of objects. Interfaces can be used to enforce a contract for object structures.
- **Classes:** Classes in TypeScript support object-oriented programming principles, providing a way to create blueprints for objects. TypeScript classes can have properties, methods, and support inheritance.
- **Functions:** Functions in TypeScript can have defined parameter types and return types, enabling static type checking. Arrow functions and anonymous functions can also be typed.

## Working with the DOM and TypeScript
TypeScript can be used for developing interactive web applications by working with the Document Object Model (DOM). TypeScript supports type-safe interactions with HTML elements and events, enhancing code reliability and maintainability.

## Generic Types
Generics in TypeScript allow the creation of reusable and flexible components. They enable the definition of functions, classes, and interfaces that can work with different types while maintaining type safety.

## Using Namespaces
Namespaces in TypeScript provide a way to organize code into logical containers, avoiding naming conflicts. Namespaces can encapsulate variables, interfaces, functions, and classes.

## Merging Declarations
TypeScript allows merging declarations of entities such as interfaces or namespaces. This is useful for extending or combining declarations from multiple sources.

## Using an Ambient Namespace to Import an External Library
Ambient declarations in TypeScript are used to tell the compiler about the shape of external code, typically JavaScript libraries. Ambient namespaces allow importing external libraries into TypeScript projects.

## Basic Nominal Typing with TypeScript
Nominal typing refers to the ability to distinguish types based on their names. While TypeScript primarily uses structural typing, nominal typing can be achieved using techniques like string literal types or unique symbol types to create named types.
