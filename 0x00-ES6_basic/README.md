# ES6 (ECMAScript 2015)

**Definition:** ES6, also known as ECMAScript 2015, is the sixth edition of the ECMAScript standard. It is a scripting language specification that forms the basis for several programming languages, including JavaScript.

# New Features Introduced in ES6

- **Let and Const Declarations:** Introduced `let` and `const` for block-scoped variables. `let` allows reassignment, while `const` creates variables that cannonstant (`const`):** Represents a constant value that cannot be re-assigned. It is block-scoped.

- **Variable (`let`):** Represents a value that can be re-assigned. It is also block-scoped.

# Block-Scoped Variables

- Variables declared with `let` and `const` are block-scoped, meaning they are only accessible within the block they are defined in.

# Arrow Functions and Default Parameters

- **Arrow Functions (`=>`):** Provide a concise syntax for writing functions, with an implicit return when no braces `{}` are used.

- **Default Parameters:** Allow function parameters to have default values, which are used if no argument or an undefined value is passed.

# Rest and Spread Function Parameters

- **Rest Parameters (`...`):** Allow a function to accept any number of arguments as an array.

- **Spread Operator (`...`):** Used to split an array or object into individual elements.

# String Templating in ES6

- **Template Literals:** Allow embedding expressions within string literals using `${}`. They also support multiline strings.

# Object Creation and Properties in ES6

- **Objet be reassigned.

- **Arrow Functions:** A concise way to write functions using the arrow (`=>`) syntax. They provide a shorter syntax compared to traditional function expressions.

- **Template Literals:** Introduced backticks (\`\`) for template literals, allowing multiline strings and embedded expressions `${}`.

- **Destructuring Assignment:** Provides a concise way to extract values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables.

- **Default Parameters:** Allows function parameters to have default values.

- **Rest and Spread Operators:** The rest operator (`...`) gathers the remaining parameters into an array, while the spread operator is used to split an array or object into individual elements.

- **Classes:** Introduced a more concise syntax for creating and working with classes.

- **Modules:** A way to structure code in separate files, making it easier to organize and reuse code.

# Constant vs Variable

- **Coct Destructuring:** A concise way to extract properties from objects.

- **Object Shorthand Notation:** Simplifies the process of creating objects by allowing shorthand syntax when the property name matches the variable name.

# Iterators and for-of Loops

- **Iterators:** Objects that define a `next()` method to iterate over elements.

- **`for-of` Loop:** A loop specifically designed for iterating over iterable objects like arrays.

Understanding these concepts in ES6 is crucial for modern JavaScript development, as these features enhance readability, maintainability, and overall developer productivity.
