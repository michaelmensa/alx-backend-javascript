ods and the procedural steps to add them to a class.

### 4. Class Extension

Master the art of extending a class from another. Gain insights into the inheritance mechanism, allowing the creation of derived classes with enhanced or modified functionalities# ES6 Classes Mastery Project

## Project Objectives

By the conclusion of this project, you will attain a comprehensive understanding of ES6 classes, equipping you to articulate the following concepts without relying on external references:

### 1. Class Definition

Learn the process of defining a class in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6). Understand the syntax, structure, and essential components involved in creating a class.

### 2. Adding Methods to a Class

Grasp the methodology of incorporating methods into a class. Explore how these methods empower instances of the class to execute specific functionalities.

### 3. Static Methods in a Class

Understand the significance of static methods within a class. Explore the rationale behind incorporating static meth.

### 5. Metaprogramming and Symbols

Delve into the world of metaprogramming within the context of classes. Explore the application of symbols as unique property keys, enhancing code expressiveness and flexibility.

## Expected Proficiency

Upon successful completion of this project, you will possess the expertise to navigate and manipulate ES6 classes effectively. Whether defining classes, adding methods, incorporating static methods, extending classes, or engaging in metaprogramming, you'll be equipped to articulate these concepts with confidence and clarity. This mastery is designed to bolster your proficiency in utilizing advanced JavaScript features for class-based object-oriented programming.
